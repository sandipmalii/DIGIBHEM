During my internship, I:

1. Led the development of a hotel registration form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an intuitive user experience.
2. Drove the implementation of input validation and error handling mechanisms to enhance form usability and data integrity.
3. Collaborated with team members to conceptualize and integrate dynamic features such as date pickers and dropdown menus for room selection.
4. Learned and applied best practices in web development to optimize the form's performance and functionality.
